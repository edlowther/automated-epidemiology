        "Title": "Leveraging Policy Cutoffs as Natural Experiments to Uncover the Causal Effect of Socioeconomic Status on Mental Health",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Changes in socioeconomic status induced by policy cutoffs (e.g., minimum wage hikes, tax credit eligibility, free school meal policies) causally affect mental health outcomes, and these effects may differ by sex.",
        "Related Work": "Prior studies have used natural or quasi-natural experiments to explore SES and health links, such as refugee dispersal (Amin et al., 2022; Biddle & Bozorgmehr, 2023), school assignment (Butler et al., 2020), and urban greening (Xie et al., 2021). However, most focus on specific populations, interventions, or physical health outcomes, and often do not use multiple, clearly-defined, and easily-replicable policy thresholds as sources of exogenous SES variation. This proposal stands out by systematically leveraging multiple SES-related policy changes (with sharp eligibility cutoffs) to estimate causal effects on mental health, enabling robust, generalizable, and interpretable findings.",
        "Abstract": "The relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and mental health is widely documented, but causal inference is hampered by confounding and reverse causality. We propose to exploit exogenous SES variation generated by well-defined policy cutoffs\u2014such as minimum wage increases, earned income tax credit (EITC) eligibility, or free school meal thresholds\u2014as natural experiments to estimate the causal effect of SES on mental health outcomes. Using regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences designs, we will analyze large, population-based survey datasets (e.g., UK Biobank, NHIS, Understanding Society) linked to mental health indicators. We will systematically compare effects across multiple policy cutoffs, assess heterogeneity by sex, and examine robustness across settings. This approach offers clear interpretability, policy relevance, and replicability. Our work will provide rigorous evidence on whether and how policy-induced changes in SES impact mental health, informing both causal understanding and policy design.",
        "Experiments": [
            "Identify 2\u20133 major SES-related policy cutoffs (such as minimum wage, EITC eligibility, free school meal policy) with well-documented implementation and data availability.",

        "Risk Factors and Limitations": [
            "Policy cutoffs may not always induce large enough SES changes to affect mental health, risking null results.",
            "Mental health measures may be noisy or inconsistently measured across datasets.",
            "RD and DiD designs require strong assumptions (e.g., no manipulation around cutoff, parallel trends) that must be carefully checked.",
            "Findings may be local to the policy threshold and not generalize to broader SES variation.",
            "Data access and linkage across policies and mental health measures may be challenging."

        "Title": "Disentangling the Causal Effects of Income and Educational Attainment on Mental Health: A Large-Scale Sibling Comparison Study",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Comparing siblings discordant on income and/or educational attainment allows for more robust estimation of the causal effects of these SES dimensions on mental health outcomes, reducing confounding by shared family background and enabling direct contrasting of income and education mechanisms.",
        "Related Work": "Previous studies have used sibling comparison designs to control for family-level confounding in SES-health associations (e.g., van de Weijer et al., 2023; Hwang et al., 2021), and some have examined educational attainment and health. However, most focus on education alone, rarely compare income and education side-by-side within families, and often neglect systematic examination of effect heterogeneity (e.g., by sex, age) or a range of mental health outcomes. This proposal advances the literature by directly contrasting income and education effects on mental health using within-family (sibling fixed-effect) models in large population datasets, providing a clear, replicable framework and simple sensitivity analyses.",
        "Abstract": "The association between socioeconomic status (SES)\u2014particularly education and income\u2014and mental health is well-documented but plagued by concerns of confounding. We propose a large-scale sibling-comparison study leveraging datasets with sibling identifiers, SES indicators, and validated mental health measures to more robustly estimate the causal effects of income and educational attainment on mental health. By comparing siblings discordant on SES, we can control for shared familial background, thus reducing unobserved confounding. We will implement fixed-effect regression models within sibships to estimate the effects of (1) educational attainment and (2) income (analyzed separately and jointly) on a range of mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, wellbeing). We will systematically compare the magnitude and direction of these effects and examine effect modification by sex and age. Sensitivity analyses will assess robustness to measurement error and non-shared confounders. This work provides a transparent, replicable causal inference framework and directly informs the debate on whether education and/or income are causal levers for improving mental health.",
